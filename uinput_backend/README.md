This is a simple backend that avoids the whole HID specification altogether and just handles the bits directly off of a BLE Characteristic, using the uinput linux kernel module. It is based on [Bleak](https://github.com/hbldh/bleak) and [python-uinput](https://github.com/tuomasjjrasanen/python-uinput).
